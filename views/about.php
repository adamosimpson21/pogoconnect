<h1>About Page!</h1>

<h3>What the hecking is this site about?</h3>

<p>This site is a resource for rural, disabled, or any trainers who find it difficult to make it to enough pokestops to play Pokemon Go. Some people are able to hit many PokeStops on their daily commute, but not everyone can. I wanted a way to connect these two types of players, so everyone can have enough Pokeballs and berries to play as much as possible. </p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>Trainers merely enter in their Trainer Codes with some optional information. Then, any trainer can use the site to pull from the database of trainers, sorting by that optional information. Add gift givers or receivers to your Pokemon Go friends list. </p>

<h3>Who would use a site like this?</h3>

<p>Any pokemon trainer can use the site. Gift givers are generous trainers who have some gifts to spare. </p>
