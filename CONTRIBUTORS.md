The main developer of this site is BandsWithLegends, a level 39 Mystic player in Washington State, and the original gift giver. His friend's list is very full with Poke-masters who receive his gifts daily. He's also a junior Web Developer looking to help out his local community! 

BandsWithLegends is great at writing code, but horrible at writing English sentences so this space is reserved for everyone who helps BandsWithLegends on this project :D
